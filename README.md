FrontEnd Task By AlgoBulls\
# To-do Application by Hilag Shah | <a href="https://fttodoapp.netlify.app">DEMO</a>

## Requirements

[x] Tasks should be displayed in a Tabular format, using the Ant Pro table component.

## How to setup the application 

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm run mock-api`
Runs the mock-api to feed data into our todo application.\
The API will by default run on PORT 3001 [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) from where we fetch the JSON data and feed it into out ant-pro table.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.This is basically because of some configuration issues while using ant-pro tables.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
